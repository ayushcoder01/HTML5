INTRODUCTION TO HTML :-
=======================
Q1. What is HTML?
Ans. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. It tells the browser how to display text, images, links, and other content.

Q2. Is HTML a programming language? Why or why not?
Ans. No, HTML is not a programming language. It is a declarative markup language that describes the structure of a webpage and does not contain logic or algorithms.

Q3. What does “HyperText” mean in HTML?
Ans. HyperText refers to text that contains links (hyperlinks) that connect one web page to another on the Internet.

Q4. What is the purpose of HTML?
Ans. HTML structures the content of a webpage — including headings, paragraphs, links, multimedia, forms, and layout of the interface.

Q5. What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?
Ans. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML that adds semantic elements, audio/video support, SVG, canvas, localStorage, and better form controls compared to older HTML versions.


HTML STRUCTURE :-
=================
Q6. Explain the basic structure of an HTML document.
Ans. A basic HTML document contains:
 - `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
 - `<html>` root tag
 - `<head>` tag containing meta-information, title
 - `<body>` tag containing all visible content shown to users

Q7. What is the role of <!DOCTYPE html>?
Ans. It is a declaration that tells the browser to use HTML5 standards while rendering the page.

Q8. What is the difference between <head> and <body>?
Ans. `<head>` contains metadata and settings that are not displayed to the user, whereas `<body>` contains all visible content shown on the webpage.

Q9. Why should we include the lang attribute in <html>?
Ans. The `lang` attribute specifies the language of the webpage, improves accessibility, and helps search engines understand and index content correctly.

Q10. List any two semantic elements introduced in HTML5.
Ans. Examples: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`.


HTML SYNTAX :-
==============
Q11. What is the correct syntax for an HTML element?
Ans. `<tagname attribute="value">content</tagname>`

Q12. What are void/self-closing HTML tags? Give examples.
Ans. Tags that do not need a closing tag are called void tags. E.g., `<img>`, `<br>`, `<hr>`, `<input>`.

Q13. What is the purpose of the alt attribute on an <img> tag?
Ans. It provides alternative text when the image fails to load and improves accessibility for screen readers.

Q14. Differentiate between global and specific attributes.
Ans. Global attributes (like id, class, hidden, data-*) can be used on almost any HTML tag, while specific attributes are applicable only to particular tags (like href for `<a>`, src for `<img>`).

Q15. Why is it important to properly nest HTML tags?
Ans. Proper nesting ensures that the browser interprets the document correctly and avoids layout errors, especially when multiple tags are combined.


HTML HEADINGS :-
================
Q16. What are HTML heading tags?
Ans. HTML provides six heading tags <h1> to <h6> used to define headings and sub-headings. <h1> is the most important and largest, while <h6> is the least important and smallest.

Q17. Why is <h1> tag important for SEO?
Ans. Search engines use the <h1> tag to understand the main topic of the page. It should describe the page’s primary content and be used only once.

Q18. Can you skip heading tags (e.g., use <h4> after <h1> directly)?
Ans. Technically yes, but it’s not recommended. Heading tags should follow a logical hierarchy for better accessibility and SEO.

Q19. What is the difference between <title> in <head> and <h1> in <body>?
Ans. <title> appears in the browser tab and search results, while <h1> is a visible main heading in the content area.

Q20. How many <h1> tags should be used on a single page?
Ans. Ideally only one <h1> tag per page to define the main heading clearly for users and search engines.


HTML PARAGRAPH / <br> / <hr> :-
===============================
Q21. What does the <p> tag do in HTML?
Ans. The <p> tag defines a paragraph of text and automatically adds space above and below the content.

Ans. <br> inserts a single line break, while <p> starts a new paragraph block.

Q23. What is the <hr> tag used for?
Ans. <hr> stands for horizontal rule and creates a horizontal line divider between content sections.

Q24. Name one best practice when using <br> tags.
Ans. Avoid using multiple <br> tags for spacing; use CSS margins/padding instead.

Q25. Is the <hr> tag a paired tag?
Ans. No, <hr> is a self-closing void tag and does not need a closing tag.


HTML TEXT FORMATTING :-
=======================
Q26. Differentiate between <b> and <strong> tags.
Ans. Both visually make text bold, but <strong> is semantic and indicates importance, which helps screen readers and SEO.

Q27. What is the purpose of the <em> tag?
Ans. <em> displays italic text and semantically emphasizes the content.

Q28. Why should <strong>/<em> be preferred over <b>/<i>?
Ans. Because <strong> and <em> add meaning (semantic value) for accessibility, while <b> and <i> are purely presentational.
