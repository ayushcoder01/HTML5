    <h1>Why I Started Learning Web Development</h1>

    <hr />

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone starts somewhere. For me, it all began with a curiosity about how
      websites are made. I stumbled upon <strong>HTML</strong> and
      <em>never looked back</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Journey</h2>
    <h3>Discovering the Basics</h3>
    <p>
      Learning about elements like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and
      <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> was exciting! I realized how powerful simple text
      can be when structured correctly. <br /><br />
      Here’s a quick poem I wrote:
      <br />
      <em>
        Code is poetry,<br />
        Line by line we build,<br />
        A world from symbols,<br />
        Into browsers distilled.
      </em>
    </p>

    <h3>Facing Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      I had to <del>give up</del> <ins>push through</ins> many tough moments.
      But with persistence and community support, I learned that
      <mark>practice makes perfect</mark>.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      My advice: start small and <strong>don’t rush</strong>. Even giants like E
      = mc<sup>2</sup> started with basics like H<sub>2</sub>O.
      <br />
      Keep going, keep coding.
