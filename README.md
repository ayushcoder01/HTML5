# HTML Learning Project

This repository contains a collection of HTML files and notes created while learning HTML. Each folder focuses on a specific topic in HTML, from the basics to more advanced concepts.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

*   **01_Intro**: Introduction to HTML, covering the basic structure and syntax.
*   **02_Text**: Working with text elements, including headings, paragraphs, and text formatting.
*   **03_Link**: Creating hyperlinks and understanding different path types.
*   **04_Image**: Embedding images and SVGs.
*   **05_List**: Creating ordered, unordered, and description lists.
*   **06_Form**: Building forms with various input types and elements.
*   **07_Table**: Creating tables to display data.
*   **08_Media**: Working with audio and video elements.
*   **09_Semantic**: Using semantic HTML elements for better structure and accessibility.
*   **10_SEO**: SEO best practices for HTML.
*   **Interview**: A collection of HTML interview questions.
*   **Project**: A complete project that demonstrates the concepts learned.

## Notes

Each topic-specific folder (e.g., `01_Intro`, `02_Text`) contains a `notes.txt` file with detailed explanations and key points related to that topic. These notes serve as a quick reference and a study guide.

## Interview Questions

The `Interview` folder contains a collection of common HTML interview questions in two formats:

*   `Ques.html`: A web page with interview questions and code examples.
*   `Ques.txt`: A text file with questions and answers, suitable for quick revision.

The questions cover a wide range of topics, from basic HTML concepts to more advanced topics like semantic HTML and SEO.

## Project

The `Project` folder contains a hands-on project (`index.html`) that applies the various concepts covered in the learning modules. The project is a simple blog page with a header, navigation, main content area, and a footer. It includes:

*   Semantic HTML5 layout (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
*   Headings, paragraphs, and lists.
*   An embedded YouTube video using an `<iframe>`.
*   A contact form with various input types, including text fields, email, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
*   Use of `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to group form elements.

This project serves as a practical example of how to build a real-world web page using HTML.
